            <h3>Barcoding</h3>
            <p>
              Barcodes can be used to label plastic waste items or containers, enabling easier identification, sorting, and tracking throughout the recycling or disposal process.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="destination-item">
            <h3>Blockchain Technology</h3>
            <p>
              Blockchain can be employed to create a transparent and tamper-proof record of plastic waste transactions, from collection to recycling or disposal. This technology enhances traceability and accountability in plastic waste management
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="destination-item">
            <h3>GPS (Global Positioning System)</h3>
            <p>
              GPS tracking can be used to monitor the transportation of plastic waste from collection points to recycling or disposal facilities. This technology provides real-time location data, allowing for better logistics and route optimization.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="destination-item">
            <h3>RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification)</h3>
            <p>
              RFID tags can be attached to plastic waste bins or containers to track their movement and collection. RFID technology enables automatic identification and tracking of plastic waste, improving efficiency and accuracy.
